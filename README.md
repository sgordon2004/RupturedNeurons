# RupturedNeurons

This is a program I made that simulates a game of Cho Han, in which the player rolls two dice, guesses if the sum of the diice will be even or odd, and then wins or loses the amoount of money they placed on their bet. The money aspect has not yet been added to the program.

To use it, simply go to the bottom where the function is called and enter your guess (even or odd) into it. For some reason, it only returns 'None'.

WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN?
